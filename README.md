## Check your understanding
1.No you would not use a unit test for the "message" feature of a messaging application. This involves many different components working together and is effectively the main part of the application. Unit tests are bad at checking interactions between all these scenarios, being useful to debug different parts of the application, rather than it as a whole. 

2.Given this, this would be a good thing to make unit tests for. This likely required a simple check to see how they handle inputs that are more than 80 characters. Some relevent ideas to test could be does it actually limit at 80 and what happens after 80.
